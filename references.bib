  abstract   = {Background: Health datasets from clinical sources do not reflect the breadth and diversity of disease in the real world, impacting research, medical education, and artificial intelligence ({AI}) tool development. Dermatology is a suitable area to develop and test a new and scalable method to create representative health datasets.
                Methods: We used Google Search advertisements to invite contributions to an open access dataset of images of dermatology conditions, demographic, and symptom information. With informed contributor consent, we describe and release this dataset containing 10,408 images from 5,033 contributions from internet users in the United States over 8 months starting March 2023. The dataset includes dermatologist condition labels as well as estimated Fitzpatrick Skin Type ({eFST}) and Monk Skin Tone ({eMST}) labels for the images.
                Results: We received a median of 22 submissions/day ({IQR} 14–30). Female (66.72\%) and younger (52\% {\textless} age 40) contributors had a higher representation in the dataset compared to the {US} population, and 32.6\% of contributors reported a non-White racial or ethnic identity. Over 97.5\% of contributions were genuine images of skin conditions. Dermatologist confidence in assigning a differential diagnosis increased with the number of available variables, and showed a weak correlation with image sharpness (Spearman’s P values {\textless} 0.001 and 0.01 respectively). Most contributions were short-duration (54\% with onset {\textless} 7 days ago ) and 89\% were allergic, infectious, or inflammatory conditions. {eFST} and {eMST} distributions reflected the geographical origin of the dataset. The dataset is available at github.com/google-researchdatasets/scin.
                Conclusion: Search ads are effective at crowdsourcing images of health conditions. The {SCIN} dataset bridges important gaps in the availability of representative images of common skin conditions.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of Informatics that uses algorithms to tirelessly process data, understand its meaning and provide the desired outcome, continuously redefining its logic. AI was mainly introduced via artificial neural networks, developed in the early 1950s, and with its evolution into "computational learning models." Machine Learning analyzes and extracts features in larger data after exposure to examples; Deep Learning uses neural networks in order to extract meaningful patterns from imaging data, even deciphering that which would otherwise be beyond human perception. Thus, AI has the potential to revolutionize the healthcare systems and clinical practice of doctors all over the world. This is especially true for radiologists, who are integral to diagnostic medicine, helping to customize treatments and triage resources with maximum effectiveness. Related in spirit to Artificial intelligence are Augmented Reality, mixed reality, or Virtual Reality, which are able to enhance accuracy of minimally invasive treatments in image guided therapies by Interventional Radiologists. The potential applications of AI in IR go beyond computer vision and diagnosis, to include screening and modeling of patient selection, predictive tools for treatment planning and navigation, and training tools. Although no new technology is widely embraced, AI may provide opportunities to enhance radiology service and improve patient care, if studied, validated, and applied appropriately.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY: Robotic interventional neuroradiology is an emerging field with the potential to enhance patient safety, reduce occupational hazards, and expand systems of care. Endovascular robots allow the operator to precisely control guidewires and catheters from a lead-shielded cockpit located several feet (or potentially hundreds of miles) from the patient. This has opened up the possibility of expanding telestroke networks to patients without access to life-saving procedures such as stroke thrombectomy and cerebral aneurysm occlusion by highly-experienced physicians. The prototype machines, first developed in the early 2000s, have evolved into machines capable of a broad range of techniques, while incorporating newly automated maneuvers and safety algorithms. In recent years, preliminary clinical research has been published demonstrating the safety and feasibility of the technology in cerebral angiography and intracranial intervention. The next step is to conduct larger, multisite, prospective studies to assess generalizability and, ultimately, improve patient outcomes in neurovascular disease.},

  abstract = {Vessel wall MR imaging (VW-MRI) has been introduced into clinical practice and applied to a variety of diseases, and its usefulness has been reported. High-resolution VW-MRI is essential in the diagnostic workup and provides more information than other routine MR imaging protocols. VW-MRI is useful in assessing lesion location, morphology, and severity. Additional information, such as vessel wall enhancement, which is useful in the differential diagnosis of atherosclerotic disease and vasculitis could be assessed by this special imaging technique. This review describes the VW-MRI technique and its clinical applications in arterial disease, venous disease, vasculitis, and leptomeningeal disease.},
